    Vim monitoring via mistral workflow is used to replace old in-place vim
    monitoring in tacker server.
    Mistral is an integral part of tacker MANO system. To make full use of it,
    and make the tacker server scale well, the feature creates a mistral
    workflow and execute it. The mistral workflow action task then monitors
    ( currently, pings) the vim, and notifies the tacker conductor to
    update the VIM status.
