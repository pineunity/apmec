    Vim monitoring via mistral workflow is used to replace old in-place vim
    monitoring in apmec server.
    Mistral is an integral part of apmec MANO system. To make full use of it,
    and make the apmec server scale well, the feature creates a mistral
    workflow and execute it. The mistral workflow action task then monitors
    ( currently, pings) the vim, and notifies the apmec conductor to
    update the VIM status.
