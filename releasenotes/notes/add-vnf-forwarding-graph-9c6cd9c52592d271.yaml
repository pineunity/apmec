features:
  - MEA Forwarding Graph support is available as an EXPERIMENTAL feature.
    TOSCA MEC Profile based Forwarding Graph Descriptor can be uploaded
    to MEA-FGD Catalog. MEA-FFGD template describes both Classifier and
    Forwarding Path across a collection of Connection Points described in
    MEADs. Using the template MEA FFG can be instantiated using the default
    Neutron networking-sfc driver.
issues:
  - Logical source port need to be specified MEA-FFGD flow classifier
    section. This is due to the current restriction in Neutron 
    networking-sfc flow-classifier API restriction. This behavior will
    be resolved once the underlying neutron issue is fixed.
