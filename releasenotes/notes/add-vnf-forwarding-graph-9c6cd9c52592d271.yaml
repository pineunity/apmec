features:
  - VNF Forwarding Graph support is available as an EXPERIMENTAL feature.
    TOSCA NFV Profile based Forwarding Graph Descriptor can be uploaded
    to VNF-FGD Catalog. VNF-FFGD template describes both Classifier and
    Forwarding Path across a collection of Connection Points described in
    VNFDs. Using the template VNF FFG can be instantiated using the default
    Neutron networking-sfc driver.
issues:
  - Logical source port need to be specified VNF-FFGD flow classifier
    section. This is due to the current restriction in Neutron 
    networking-sfc flow-classifier API restriction. This behavior will
    be resolved once the underlying neutron issue is fixed.
