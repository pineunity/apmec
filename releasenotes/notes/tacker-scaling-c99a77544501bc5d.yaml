features:
  - VNF auto-scaling and manual-scaling feature is added, to scale in/out
    the VDUs.

issues:
  - Auto-scaling feature is supported only with alarm monitors and it does
    not work with other monitors such as ping, http_ping.
  - When VNF is modelled with scaling requirement in VNFD, any config
    management requirement in VNFD is not supported.
  - Scaling feature does not support to selectively choose the VDU as part
    of scaling.
