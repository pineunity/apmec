Tacker Development Process
==========================

Enhancement to Tacker functionality can be done using one of the following
two development process options. The choice depends on the complexity of the
enhancement.

Request for Enhancement (RFE) Process
=====================================

The developer, or an operator, can write up the requested enhancement in a
Tacker launchpad [#]_ bug.

* The requester need to mark the bug with "RFE" tag.
* The bug will be in the initial "New" state.
* The requester and team will have a discussion on the enhancement in the
  launchpad bug.
* Once the discussion is over a tacker-core team member will acknowledge the
  validity of this feature enhancement by moving it to the "Confirmed" state.
* Developers submit patchsets to implement the enhancement using the bug-id.
  Note, if there are multiple patchsets Partial-Bug header should be used
  instead of Closes-Bug in the commit message.
* Once all the patchsets are merged the bug will be moved to the "Completed"
  state.
* Developer(s) are expected to add a devref describing the usage of the feature
  and other related topics in tacker/doc/source/contributor directory.

This process is recommended for smaller enhancements that can be described
easily and it is relatively easy to implement in a short period of time.

Blueprint and Tacker-Specs process
==================================

The developer, or an operator, can write up the requested enhancement by
submitting a patchset to the tacker-spec repository [#]_.

* The patchset should follow the template specified in [#]_
* The requester should also create a corresponding blueprint for the
  enhancement proposal in launchpad [#]_
* The requester and the team will have a discussion on the tacker-spec
  writeup using gerrit.
* The patchset will be merged into the tackers-specs repository if the
  tacker-core team decides this is a valid feature enhancement. A patchset
  may also be rejected with clear reasoning.
* Tacker core team will also mark the blueprint Definition field to Approved.
* Developer submits one or more patchsets to implement the enhancement. The
  commit message should use "Implements: blueprint <blueprint-name>" using
  the same name as the blueprint name.
* Once all the patchsets are merged the blueprint will be as "Implemented" by
  the tacker core team.
* The developer is expected to add a devref describing the usage of the feature
  and other related topics in tacker/doc/source/contributor directory.

This process is recommended for medium to large enhancements that needs
significant code-changes (LOC), community discussions and debates.
