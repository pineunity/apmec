- Framework-eval worked well when the number of instances is still available

- WIP: when the number of instances is not enough but the size of NS is same

- Next: Add new NFs to NS


-------------------------------------
Current code:

The NS service is reused if the number of NFs in the requested NSs is same with the offered NS

The VM capacity = 2
